Project Title:
Single Cable Machine Queue Simulation

Project Overview:
In this project I simulate the line for one cable machine in a 24-hour gym. There is only one machine, so people have to wait, use it, and then leave. The goal is to see how the line changes over time: how many are waiting, who is using the machine, and who is finished.

Data Structure:
I will use a std::map<string, MachineLists>. The key is the machine name ("Cable Machine"). The value is a std::array<std::list<std::string>, 3>.  
Index 0 = waiting list,  
index 1 = currently using,  
index 2 = finished.

File Input and Simulation:
At the start, the program will read at least 100 lines from a text file like:

    Cable Machine,Alice,0

and put each member in the correct list. Then main() will show time step 0 and run about 30 time steps. I will write three functions: loadInitialData, simulateTimeSteps, and printGymState to keep the code organized.
